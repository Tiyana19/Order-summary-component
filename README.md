### Built with 

- Semantic HTML5 markup 
- CSS custom properties 
- Flexbox 

### What I learned 

I learned about Flexbox and I also try using relative units as much as I can. 

# github lesson that I learned 
I also learned that github is (Case Sensitive) so in the future I will remember this and try to keep the folder and files name in lower cases by default.

### Continued developemt 

I will do more practice of width and height sizes because I usally got stuck on these two properites the most. and also will give more attention to layout and display properties.
